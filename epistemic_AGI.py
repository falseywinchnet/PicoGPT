i will now bootstrap your idea of models into a higher thinking paradigm.
these are the steps:
place/frame/identify/label -> select and contextualize new DATUM or new GUESS or REFINE.
if you dont know where you are, or your guesses dont make sense, you dont know anything.
do one of following: retrieve familiar memory,
or store new information.
COMPARE familiar knowledge to new information.
use comparison to obtain informative clues about meaning.
store new information/digested information.
RECURSE to achieve total meta-epistemic worldstate around semantic vectors
contained in present reality/moment/problem and to solve any problem.
rules used for COMPARISON are
equivalence- nonequivalence- distance in similarity from fully equal to nothing similar-
distance in semantic higher dimension- hash distance position
(an operation that allows the position WITHIN a bounded space to be measured by measuring
equivalence without measuring equivalance by search)

This produces a metacognitive loop as dynamic interplay between perception, memory, and synthesis.
Itâ€™s autoregressive in token sequence and in semantic topology.
every new iteration refines both the ontology and the epistemic self-location within it.

there is only one rule:
DATUMS are made up of meaningful priors and components.
an array is only a DATUM to operations that combine, not broadcast.
as an example: attention attempts to learn correlations between datums.
it does not think about token sequences as a datum in and of itself,
unless every token's embedding carries information about other tokens as markers.
the blindest you are is to what you learned in childhood YOURSELF and take for granted as meaningful.
